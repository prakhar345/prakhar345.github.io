Users are often faced with the dilemma of switching to Linux from Windows, with

Windows already providing a multitude of functionalities and being quite easy. But

some features of Linux make it stand out and programmers’ favorite.

 Though Linux will not help in developing Windows applications, but it is always

preferable to use Linux while developing cross-platform applications and web services.

 In many cases when website and mobile app backends fail to run on Windows. In such

cases, Linux comes to our rescue. Setting up the test environment in Windows does not

help either as it does not even replicate the live environment.

 Linux is an open-source project, making the source code of Linux OS available to the

users to understand its working, make changes according to the requirements, or add

functionalities.

 The security of Linux cannot be questioned neither be breached. It does not require

downloading and installation of antiviruses like Windows to keep the computer safe

from malware.

 For developers, Linux Terminal outdoes Windows command line. Many libraries are

native to Linux. Also, programmers find package manager on Linux a useful tool for easy

completion of tasks.

 Bash Scripting in Linux is also one of the reasons of Linux being programmers’ preferred

choice.

 Native support for SSH in Linux helps in easy and quick management of servers. Features

like apt-get commands and others is also a reason for preference of Linux over

Windows.
